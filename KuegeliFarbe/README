Python3 scripts to:
- Recognize the color of a marble using the apds9960
- Play a note with pysonic depending on the color of the marble

the apds9960 library was taken from here:
https://github.com/liske/python-apds9960
and converted with 2to3.py to python3.

Depending on the color of the room you have to calibrate the color reference table in kuegelifarbe.py

Todo: Use machine learning to distinguish colors. Added training sample
